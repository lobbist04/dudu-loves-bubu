            <p>I wrote this code because words sometimes fail to describe how much you mean to me.</p>
            <p>You are the perfect logic in my chaotic world. Every "Yes" from you is a successful build in my life.</p>
            <p>I promise to be the one who fixes your bugs, shares your snacks, and loves you forever.</p>
            <p><strong>Will you stay in my 'Main' branch forever?</strong></p>
